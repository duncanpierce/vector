/*
Package vec8 provides functions for efficiently manipulating fixed-length arrays of size 8.

It is one of several packages, each operating on a single size of array:

  - [github.com/duncanpierce/vector/vec2] for arrays of length 2
  - [github.com/duncanpierce/vector/vec4] for arrays of length 4
  - [github.com/duncanpierce/vector/vec8] for arrays of length 8
  - [github.com/duncanpierce/vector/vec16] for arrays of length 16
  - [github.com/duncanpierce/vector/vec32] for arrays of length 32
  - [github.com/duncanpierce/vector/vec64] for arrays of length 64
